There are three preserved faces.  One is flat and thickest (max. pres. width) closest to the break edge (though not directly at the break edge) and tapers as it goes towards a terminus.  The terminus is a raised knob max. pres. height of 0.00405m and max. pres. width of 0.00486m.  The flat portion of this face also appears to preserve three concentric circle designs (max. pres. diam. 0.00301m), with one raised ring and one raised dot at the center.  One edge of this face is 0.00135m in thickness and curves around to a trajectory parallel to the face just described for a width of 0.00285m.  This face then projects away 0.00350m from the parallel trajectory in a convex manner.  The edge of this face is 0.00075m in thickness and curves concavely inward, corresponding to the convex shape of the immediately previously described face, until it also parallels the first face described.  This arrangement gives the fragment a width profile which is roughly a  J  shape (or backwards  J  shape, depending on how viewed).  In its length profile, the curved portion of the catchplate slopes inward at approximately a 25 degree angle from the terminus and the break edge of the first described face.","","","",""

One face is decorated with a standing figure of a robed male, and to the left is a depiction of a rosary.  Around the upper and right edge is an inscription: San Domenico.  Some letters are occluded.  On the other side is a relief of a seated virgin and child, surrounded by a border of stars or asterisks.","Gilt bronze","","",""

The fragment is somewhat trapezoidal in profile and section.  Along one break edge, which in section itself looks like a narrow isosceles triangle, preserves two of these impressions.  The first is close to a perpendicular break edge and max. pres. width of 0.00445m; it is relatively shallow.  0.00384m from it is another circular impression, 0.00388m in diameter, which is deeper than the previously described impression.  On a perpendicular probably finished side, two more impressions appear near the opposite break edge.  One is max. pres. width of 0.00360m and the other is 0.00212m.  There are some other slight indentations on this face, but none appears to be an intentional impression.  Corrosion of this artifact makes it difficult to determine exactly the original shape and character of this object versus its broken components.","","","",""
